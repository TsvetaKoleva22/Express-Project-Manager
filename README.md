<p>The project uses Express as a back-end framework, MongoDB as a database with Mongoose and Handlebars as a view engine. It is an  application for managing projects and the teams in them.</p> 
<p>Guest (not logged in) users are able to login, register and view the Home page.<br>
Logged in users can logout, view all teams, view all projects, view their profile and leave a team.<br>
The Admin (seeded at the start of the application) can logout, distribute teams, distribute projects, create teams, create projects and  view their profile.</p>
<p>The app offeres the following views:<br> 
- Guest pages - Index page, Login page, Register page.
- User pages - Projects page, Teams page, Profile page with My teams and My projects.
- Admin pages - Create team page, Create project page, Admin Projects page for distributing projects to the teams, Admin Teams page for distributing users to the existing teams.<br>
Each page has access security restrictions (for example a guest cannot access Projects page, etc.)<br>
As a bonus feature, the app supports two searching options - an user can search in teams or in projects for a certain string.
